# StudyTrack
Timer to manage student study time
This app has a sprint game mode which gives the user 15 minutes of break for every 30 minutes of study.
This app has a procrastinator mode which gives the user an hour interval of work for a 30 minute break.
This app has an expert mode which gives the user an hour and a half interval of work for a 30 minute break.
All game modes save the users time after the break, but once the user clicks home, the values are reset.
This app is very simple to use, the user first selects a mode and then when the allocated break button appears after the respective times, the user may press the button to go on break and then press the resume button to resume study.
